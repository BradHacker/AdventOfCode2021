# Advent of Code 2021

This year, my goal is to learn how to write Rust. I'm sure it's going to be plenty of patched together code that is not in any _rust-specific_ style, but I still want to gain a better appreciation for Rust.

# File Structure

Each day is going to have it's own folder, with a `part1.rs` and `part2.rs`

```
dayxx/
  src/
    part1.rs
    part2.rs
    ...
  ...
...
```

# Running my code

To run each of the parts for each day, simply just (where `xx` is the day number and `x` is the part number):

```
cd dayxx
cargo run --bin partx
```
